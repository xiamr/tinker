                    ---------------------------------------
                    SOURCE Directory for the TINKER Package
                    ---------------------------------------

         This subdirectory contains the Fortran 95 source code for the
         current version of the TINKER program package.

         The code is in a standard Fortran dialect that should compile
         unchanged on most machines. Script files to build the package
         on a variety of systems are in subdirectories named for the
         machine/operating system.

         Only a few source files may require editing prior to building:
         "sizes.f" which contains some master array dimensions used
         throughout the package, and "openend.f" which is a system
         dependent routine to open a file at the end.

         If you are building an OpenMP-capable version of TINKER with
         a compiler other than the Intel Fortran compiler, then it is
         necessary to comment or remove the calls to the Intel-specific
         extensions "kmp_set_stacksize" and "kmp-set-blocksize" near
         the top of the source file "initial.f".

         In addition, if your system does not support the iargc/getarg
         mechanism for command line arguments, then comment out the
         call to the subroutine "command" at the bottom of the source
         file "initial.f".
